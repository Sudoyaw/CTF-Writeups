This is the challenge walkthroughs/writeup for the **2024 3108 CTF Kembara Tuah**

The competition was dated at 30-08-24 and it lasted for a total of 24 hours. The theme for this year's competition was around the states of Malaysia and the challenges were all related to them one way or two.  

It was a really unique and fun experience as this was my first time participating the `3108` CTF and I am really looking forward for this competition in the upcoming years. 

I've successfully secured 43rd place in this competition and here are my solutions to the challenges I managed to solve throughout the competition.
